```groovy
implementation "me.saket.reuserview:reuserview:4.1.2021"
```

```diff
- androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
+ androidx.recyclerview.widget.ReuserView
```

imagine your view holder is a plastic bottle

the binding model is some delicious coca cola

when you replace the cola with some water, you're reusing the bottle

when you take the bottle and turn it into google home mini fabric, you're recycling

these two things are not the same
